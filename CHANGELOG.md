# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Per-conversation working folder: each conversation runs its agent in its own
  directory (auto `$STATE_DIR/work/<slug>` by default). New `/cwd <path>`
  command redirects a conversation to a chosen folder (e.g. `~/Valter`);
  `/cwd default` reverts. Shown in `/status`.
- Image and audio message processing. Image messages are handed to the agent to
  read; audio (voice notes) are transcribed to text via a pluggable command
  (`WABOX_TRANSCRIBE_CMD`, `WABOX_TRANSCRIBE_TIMEOUT`). Captions are included and
  media is staged under `<working-folder>/wabox-media/`. The `backend_reply`
  contract gains three optional media arguments.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- CI: bats tests no longer require the `claude` binary on `PATH`. The
  claude-code backend's `backend_check_dependencies` ran at source time
  in v0.1.0, which made it impossible to source the backend purely for
  its function definitions (as bats does) without the backend's runtime
  binaries installed. The check is now deferred to a
  `run_backend_dependency_check` helper that the entrypoint invokes; the
  runtime behaviour is unchanged (`wabox-bot` still fails fast at startup
  when `CLAUDE_BIN` isn't on `PATH`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Initial extraction from
  [`wabox/examples/wabox-claude-code.sh`](https://github.com/rodgco/wabox/blob/v0.1.10/examples/wabox-claude-code.sh)
  as a standalone project.
- Pluggable agent backends via `WABOX_BOT_BACKEND` env var / `--backend` flag.
- Built-in backends:
  - `claude-code` — drives the Claude Code CLI with per-conversation
    `--resume`/`--session-id`, plus slash commands `/model`, `/mode`,
    `/system`.
  - `echo` — echoes the user's text back; useful for smoke-testing.
- Core slash commands `/clear`, `/reset`, `/ping`, `/status`, `/help`.
- Single-instance flock, per-conversation flock, atomic outbox writes via
  dot-prefixed `tmp` + `rename`, configurable `PROCESSED_DIR` for audit.
- Migration shim: existing flat `$SESSIONS_DIR/*.session` files (and the old
  `$STATE_DIR/agent.lock` path) from `wabox-claude-code.sh` are migrated into
  the namespaced layout on first run, with byte-identical slash-command
  behavior for the default `claude-code` backend.
- `install.sh` one-liner: clones to `~/.local/share/wabox-bot`, symlinks
  `bin/wabox-bot` into `~/.local/bin/`.
